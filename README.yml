       Importance of Big data in predicting stock price 
   abstract: >
       In this project, we will predict the stock price of few
       selected technology companies such as Amazon, Yahoo depending
       on the historical data of x years. Similarly, we will predict
       the price based on y years of data.  The prediction will be
       based on S&P 500 market return and market risk volatility.
       Here y > x and then we will compare the predicted prices with
       the current stock price. This project will help us understand
       if more historic data helps in predicting the stock price or it
       adds noise. We will be using statistical approach and CAPM
       [capital asset pricing model ] to predict stock price.
