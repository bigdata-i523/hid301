  abstract  = {This chapter provides the conceptual background and overview of big data-driven innovation in society. Specifically, it examines the nature of data-driven innovation, exemplars of big data-driven innovations in sectors spanning healthcare, public sector, finance, media, energy, and transport. It discusses core enablers for these innovations highlighting factors and challenges associated with the adequate diffusion, uptake, and sustainability of big data-driven initiatives. Finally, it presents policy recommendations to guide the development of a big data innovation ecosystem.},
